**General**
Scope2D is a level editor for 2D games. Unlike most games it doesn't use tiles, but you can use any image you like.

**How to use it**
The docs from the above link are outdated for the shortcuts. They are now loosley based on Autodesk's Maya software.
Now you move trough the scene/map by alt-dragging it around (you can also use cmd on a mac).
Zooming is done via the mousewheel.
Press Space to bring up the graphics selection window.

Tools-Shortcuts: Q,W,E,R
Shift: Toggle Tools-Option
Select All: Cmd+A
Deselect All: Cmd+D
Clone: Cmd+C
(on windows you use Ctrl instead of Cmd of course)

**Developers**
