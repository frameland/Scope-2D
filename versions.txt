r5:
- Most importantly, the file format is now css!
- In the upper right of the toolbar there are 3 icons now which represent modes:
	1) Edit Mode
	2) Collision Mode
	3) Event Mode
   You will probably only ever want to use mode 1. The other modes are more for my own needs but maybe you find them useful.
   In those modes simply right click and you will create a shape.
- The lower left area in the inspector can be safely ignored for now (again, something for my own needs)

Other improvements:
- You can Middle click drag the whole view instead Cmd-Dragging it.
- Use S and D keys to quickly decrease/increase the selected entities layer
- Use F key to immediately focus on the selected entity
- Use Cmd-R to get a Birds Eye view of your scene
- You can now click into an empty space to deselect everything, still using Cmd-D is your friend :)
- Many tiny little detail improvements
