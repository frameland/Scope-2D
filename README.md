**General**  
Scope2D is non tilebased level editor for 2D games.  
Get Precompiled binaries here: http://scope2d.com

**How to use it**  
Online documentation: http://scope2d.com/docs  

**First Launch**
The first time you start Scope2D it will ask you where to look for graphics and scene files. It will then open the config.css file(source/ressource/config.css) and let you specify the path to these folders. The path can be relative to Scope2D's main folder or an absolute path.

**Developers**  
If you want to compile Scope2D yourself you will need the following:
- BlitzMax compiler -> http://www.blitzbasic.com/Products/_index_.php
- MaxGui Module (usually included in the latest BlitzMax version)
- desktopext Module -> http://www.chaos-interactive.de/de/desktopextension/

**Included Graphics**  
The graphics are from http://www.lostgarden.com/ by Daniel Cook
